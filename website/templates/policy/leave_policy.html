                • All employees are entitled to 8 days of casual leave (CL) and 13 days of privilege leave (PL) per year
                after the completion of the probation period.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                1. Privilege leaves are provided for planned long leaves for the purpose of travel, vacation, etc. These
                leaves are earned on a monthly basis and the unused leaves can be carried forward to the next one year
                only.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                2. Casual leaves are for certain unforeseen situations; the employee can take one or two days of leave.
                These leaves are not carried forward.

                    • Kindly note only Privilege Leaves can be utilized for long leaves.

            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • The employee is eligible to take 1.75 leaves every month after successful completion of the probation.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • Employees completing the probation period between the 1st and 15th of a month will be eligible for
                paid leave from that particular month.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • Employees completing the probation period between the 16th and 30th of a month will be eligible for
                paid leave from next month onwards.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • It is mandatory for all the employees to have their leaves sanctioned by the Reporting Manager at
                least two days in advance. Employees must apply for leave via mail. In rare cases, when the prior mail
                is not possible, employees should get approval via mail within 2 days of rejoining. In case of any
                emergency, you are required to inform about your absence along with the reason for absence to the
                Reporting Manager and HR department. No late leave petitions will be entertained, especially after the
                month end.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • Leave can be taken for even a half day at a time. As a professional, it is expected that employees
                would inform their Reporting Manager in advance if they expect to take a day or half-day off. Leaving
                messages with the receptionist or colleagues is not acceptable.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • In ‘Leave Management', there is a concept of 'Prefix/ Suffix'. Normally, the company permits
                Sundays/Closed Holidays to be either prefixed or suffixed with leave, but not both. For example, if an
                employee takes leave on Monday, Sunday can be permitted as a prefix. And if an employee is on leave on
                Saturday, Sunday can be given as a suffix. If the employee is on leave on Saturday and also on Monday,
                then in that case, the employee has to be on leave from Saturday to Monday (3 days) since he/she can't
                have the privilege of having Sunday both as a prefix & suffix.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • Employees willing to use their comp-off during long leave can take it either at the start or end of
                the leave period. It cannot be adjusted to the middle days of the leave period.
            </p>
            <p class="leave-policy-text">
                • The leave entitlement runs from January to December. It will be pro-rata for employees joining after
                January 1st.
